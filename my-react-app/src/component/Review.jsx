            I started using SORTYAL in 9th grade just to stay organized — but it ended up becoming my secret weapon.

I could literally see my growth over time, get matched with universities that made sense for me, and stay on track without losing my mind. The platform made the whole college thing feel less scary and more doable.

When I got into MIT, I realized how much SORTYAL shaped my path. It didnt just track my journey — it helped build it.

            <p> Didnt stress about college much at first. I picked up SORTYAL sometime after 10th grade just to get a read on where I stood.

No fluff. No overwhelm. It showed me exactly what I needed to improve — and what actually mattered.

I didnt use it for years. But when I did, it worked. Now Im at Yale.
